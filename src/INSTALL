To compile (and install):

    make

Then move the generated binary ("mrmodeltest2") somewhere in the PATH. 



For Mac users:

The Makefile.MACOSX is not tested recently.
Try changing the 'CFLAGS -L' option if in trouble.


For compiling on windows:

Uncomment the lines in mrmodeltest2.c saying "For windows"
Then compile using your favourite Windows C compiler (I used mingw in the past).
